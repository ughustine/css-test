        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>Straight out of the womb, I was born with a hasseblad xpan in my hands. At the tender age of 0 I was decisive moment-ing everything known to man. Many great photographs mave been made by me. If you've ever seen a photo with your own two eyes, chances are I probabbly took it.</p>

        <h3>Illustration</h3>
        <p>Alongside the hasseblad, I was also born with a full set of paints, pens, ink, charcoal, papers, graphite and various other art suplies. Alongside making picutres with my eyes, I was able to imagine everything I wasn't able to capture in front of me and literally make something out of nothing.</p>
